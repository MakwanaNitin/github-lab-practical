GitHub collaboration enables developers to work together on projects seamlessly, regardless of location.
<br> Teams can contribute code through pull requests, review changes, and discuss improvements before merging them into the main branch.
<br> Issues and project boards help organize tasks, track progress, and manage workflows. With features like forking, branching, and continuous integration, GitHub makes collaborative software development more efficient and transparent.

<br>Would you like me to also give you a quick comparison of GitHub vs GitLab collaboration features so you can see how they differ?
