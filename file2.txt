Git branching allows developers to work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase.
<br> Each branch represents a separate line of development that can be merged back into the main branch when ready.
<br>This makes collaboration easier, as multiple people can work on different tasks simultaneously.
<br>Branching also helps in experimenting safely, since changes can be tested before being integrated into production.
